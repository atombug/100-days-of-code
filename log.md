# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 01, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Learned Flexbox, started Javascript30 and did completed 01 - javascript drum kit.

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is really good, started Javascript30 and completed javascript drum kit though data-key was new concept for me.
